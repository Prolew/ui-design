# How To Read

If you are a newcomer, reading the API reference maybe not the best
option to start learning. If you want to get a gist of how it is like
to code with Build UI, take a look at the [tutorial](https://www.google.com).

This API section provides an in-depth explanation for Build UI's 
interface. What you will find are mostly React Components and Hooks,
so this is where you'll find what props get passed for Build UI Components
and input and return values for Build UI hooks.

If you want to take a shot at reading the whole reference
or a large part of it, we have ordered it in such a way to make learning feel 
natural and progressive. If you only want to use in a dictionary fashion 
to look up for specific stuff from the API, disregard the ordering. 

Grab some coffee and happy reading! ðŸ¤“ðŸ“š
