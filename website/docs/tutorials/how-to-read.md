# How To Read

If you are a newcomer, this is the recommended starting point for learning. If you 
are not, having a quick refresh never hurts.

This Tutorials section is written with the intention of giving a general overview
of how coding a website editor with Build UI feels like. It is not supposed
to be an extensive tutorial and does not fully cover everything Build UI has to offer. 
You can go check out the API section for an in-depth reference or the Guide Section for *how-to-do* recipes.  

You can choose to hand-type the examples or clone the github repository:

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/LuisMPS/build-ui/
> cd build-ui/examples/tutorial
> npm install
> npm run dev
```
