# How To Read

The Guide Section consists of *how-to-do* recipes. They guide you through the steps 
involved in some common use cases. They assume some knowledge of how Build UI works. 

Follow any of the guides when it suits your needs and it is applicable to your 
particular use case. They are not supposed to be dogmatic guidelines. 

This include guides for stuff like: exporting your builder as static HTML and CSS,
saving your Builder state to a file or a server, coding your layer logic, or
having a drop-wherever Photoshop-like website builder.
