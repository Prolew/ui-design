# Build-UI for React JS

Build-UI is a simple library thought for React developers packed with fetures that allow them to effortlessly create website builders. It comes with drag and drop functionality, undo-redo logic, site serialization and deserialization along with some other interesting tools out of the box. Because of the way it is built, it also supports other features such as SSR and component dynamic loading without you having to worry about their implementations.
